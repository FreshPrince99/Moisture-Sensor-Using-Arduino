Urinary incontinence can have a devastating impact on a patient's life, with significant financial implications. Non-surgical treatments such as pelvic floor muscle training and the use of mechanical devices are often the first line of treatment, especially when a patient does not want surgery or when they are deemed unfit for surgery. The mechanical device is inexpensive and does not interfere with future surgical treatment. In view of such a similar situation, we made use of fusion360 technology and Arduino technology to program codes, model outer packaging, design circuits, etc., to make urinary incontinence detection devices and metal detection devices. This is because the device can help patients with early detection and personalised treatment and can prevent the onset of the disease. This paper introduces the design and manufacture of urinary incontinence devices, which can solve the problem of urinary incontinence and improve the quality of life of patients.

In this project, my team and I developed an innovative incontinence sensor designed to detect the presence of urine. Utilizing the DHT11 sensor, we seamlessly programmed and crafted a case that can be comfortably attached to pads using Arduino. The sensor swiftly identifies the presence of urine and triggers a wireless alarm, alerting caregivers promptly. Additionally, we engineered a metal detector to ensure the sensor's functionality and presence while worn by the patient.


Recent technological advances in the detection of urinary events have led to many UI management
systems previously unavailable. Urine detection sensor technology, combined with digital data
processing and transmission technology, has made it possible to make a timely detection of a urination
event and notify the caregiver via an alarm. This wet diaper alarm system (WDAS) helps the caregiver to
change the wet diaper early enough to save the diaper wearer from discomfort and a skin health
problem. A WDAS can also be used to wake a child experiencing enuresis for toilet training, as well as

generate valid urination event data to accurately assess voiding patterns of individuals to establish
personalised urinary continence care plans. This diagram shows how the device works.
The initial wearable device designed for managing urinary incontinence, the DFree, employs ultrasound
technology to continuously monitor bladder volume. The sensor must be positioned approximately 0.5
inches above the pubic bone for accurate bladder detection. Utilising safe and non-invasive ultrasound
technology, the DFree device is akin to the ultrasound technology commonly employed in prenatal care
and various consumer products like toothbrushes, ensuring its safety for users. Through connectivity
with smart devices, the DFree system transmits alerts to a user's smartphone or tablet, notifying them
when it is advisable to visit the restroom. Users can customise notification thresholds to specify when
alerts are received, allowing for sufficient time to respond to the notification.
In our experiment, we put a temperature and humidity sensor in the middle of the diaper, just like the
picture above, to absorb moisture and to detect it and send an alarm. Following a sequence of
experimental procedures, a total of four laboratory sessions were dedicated to conducting various tests.
Subsequently, the testing apparatus and the incontinence device were successfully fabricated and
demonstrated operational functionality.
