# Moisture-Sensor-Using-Arduino

In this project, my team and I developed an innovative incontinence sensor designed to detect the presence of urine. Utilizing the DHT11 sensor, we seamlessly programmed and crafted a case that can be comfortably attached to pads using Arduino. The sensor swiftly identifies the presence of urine and triggers a wireless alarm, alerting caregivers promptly. Additionally, we engineered a metal detector to ensure the sensor's functionality and presence while worn by the patient.

The project currently is in progress and will be over by next week.
